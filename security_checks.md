## üéØ **Overview**
Comprehensive security enhancement plan for the NIC Call Center System, covering application-level security, infrastructure hardening, and production deployment on DigitalOcean VPS.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES (Priority 1)**

### **1. Route-Level Authorization Bypass**
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: Users can access unauthorized routes by typing URLs directly
**Examples**:
- Motor Admin accessing `/admin/agents` (should be Life Admin only)
- Sales Agent accessing `/admin/upload` directly
- Call Center Agent accessing `/admin/reports`

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create `RoleProtectedRoute` component with LOB validation
- [ ] Implement route guards for all admin functions
- [ ] Add unauthorized access page (`/unauthorized`)
- [ ] Update all protected routes in `App.jsx`
- [ ] Test all user types against restricted routes

### **2. Customer Data Access Control**
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: Users can access customer data from other LOBs via direct URLs
**Examples**:
- Motor Admin accessing `/customers/123` (Life customer)
- Health Admin viewing Motor customer details
- Cross-LOB data enumeration via URL manipulation

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Add customer access validation in `CustomerDetail` component
- [ ] Implement LOB-based customer filtering in backend
- [ ] Add customer ownership validation before data display
- [ ] Create access denied component for unauthorized customer access
- [ ] Log all unauthorized customer access attempts

### **3. API-Level Security Gaps**
**Risk Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: Frontend-only filtering can be bypassed via direct API calls
**Examples**:
- Direct API calls to get customers from other LOBs
- Bypassing frontend validation through browser dev tools
- API endpoints not validating user context

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement server-side authorization in Xano functions
- [ ] Add user context validation to all API endpoints
- [ ] Create API middleware for LOB access control
- [ ] Validate user permissions on every API request
- [ ] Add API rate limiting and abuse detection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUES (Priority 2)**

### **4. Session Management Vulnerabilities**
**Risk Level**: üü† **HIGH**
**Current Issues**:
- JWT tokens valid for 7 days (too long for financial app)

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Reduce token expiry to 2-4 hours
- [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism
- [ ] Add automatic session timeout on inactivity
- [ ] Move tokens to httpOnly cookies (if possible)
- [ ] Add session invalidation on multiple failed attempts
- [ ] Implement concurrent session limits per user

### **5. Audit Logging and Monitoring**
**Risk Level**: üü† **HIGH**
**Current Issues**:
- Basic logging only
- No security event monitoring
- No unauthorized access tracking

- [ ] Log all data access attempts (successful and failed)
- [ ] Track unauthorized route access attempts
- [ ] Monitor API abuse and suspicious patterns
- [ ] Create security dashboard for administrators
- [ ] Set up alerts for security violations

### **6. Input Validation and Sanitization**
**Risk Level**: üü† **HIGH**
**Current Issues**:
- Limited input validation on forms
- No XSS protection on user inputs
- CSV upload validation could be bypassed
- No SQL injection protection (Xano handles this)

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation on all forms
- [ ] Implement XSS protection for user-generated content
- [ ] Enhance CSV upload validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add file type and size validation for uploads
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection tokens

- [ ] Implement secure data export/import
- [ ] Add data retention and deletion policies
- [ ] Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance
- [ ] Implement secure backup encryption

### **9. Error Handling and Information Disclosure**
**Current Status**: Development-level error messages
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement production-safe error messages
- [ ] Remove stack traces from production errors
- [ ] Add generic error pages for security violations
- [ ] Implement secure error logging
- [ ] Hide system information from error responses
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
